/**
 * Name: Daniel Seymour
 * Assignment: Module 4, Section C
 * Term: December 2015
 * Course name: C++ Programming
 * Course number: COS-213-OL012
 * 
 * Develop the class Polynomial. The internal representation of a Polynomial is 
 * an array of terms. Each term contains a coefficient and an exponent. The 
 * term 2x^4 has the coefficient of 2 and the exponent 4. Develop a complete 
 * class containing proper constructor and destructor functions as well as set
 *  and get functions. The class should also provide the following overloaded 
 *  operator capabilities:
 *  
 *  Overload the addition operator (+) to add two Polynomials.
 *  Overload the subtraction operator (âˆ’) to subtract two Polynomials.
 *  
 *  Remember that when you submit this assignment, you should acknowledge to 
 *  your mentor that you have reviewed all programs using a C++ compiler.
